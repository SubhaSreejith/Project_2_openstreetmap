Map Area: Bangalore, India

I chose Bengaluru for my analysis as I knew that the dataset will be large enough to do analysis and it will have opportunities on data wrangling. 
I am currently living here.

Is there a list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources)? N/A
